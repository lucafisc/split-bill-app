### Useful resources

- [Put icon inside input element in a form (not as background image!)](https://localcoder.org/put-icon-inside-input-element-in-a-form-not-as-background-image) - This helped me to understand how to place the icons inside the input fields with a wrapping div with its position set to relative. Then it was just a matter of setting the image position to absolute and moving it to the exact location with the top and left attributes.
